This repository contains the auto-generated code for the CircleCI API v2 Java client.

## BEFORE YOU START: IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
The CircleCI v2 API is currently in Preview release. You may use it at will, but this evaluation product is not yet fully supported or considered generally available. We have no plans to change any live endpoints in v2, and we are treating it as production software, but the risk of disruption or breaking changes is higher than our generally available features. All breaking changes will be announced ahead of time in our [breaking changes log](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs/blob/master/docs/breaking.md) 

Use of the v2 API as long as this notice is in the master branch (current as of June 2019) is done at your own risk and is governed by CircleCIâ€™s Terms of Service.

PREVIEWS ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS," AND "AS AVAILABLE," AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS AND LIMITED WARRANTY. Previews may not be covered by customer support. Previews may be subject to reduced or different security, compliance and privacy commitments, as further explained in the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and any additional notices provided with the Preview. We may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice. We also may choose not to release a Preview into "General Availability."

## Code generation

from the spec available at https://circleci.com/api/v2/openapi.json

The latest version of the Java client is available for download from
